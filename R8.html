You head to the orchard you spent the morning in. You kick apples around in the dark and think back over every moment of your interaction with Juliet. Her soft, inviting lips, the way her golden hair framed her glowing face. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
How could the fates be so cruel as to keep the two of you apart? To saddle you both in the midst of this massive rivalry? You try to imagine a life without Juliet, but without her everything is meaningless. The life that stretches before you is callous and bare. It&#8217;s not a life that you want to live.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You find some rope coiled at the base of one of the apple trees. You tie it around the strongest branch you can find before looping a noose around your neck.
You cry out at the stars one last time before letting the weight of your body take you to a place where you don&#8217;t have to experience the cruelty of fate anymore.
