You keep wandering the streets, making turns at random. The sun beats down on your back and you can feel your skin baking, but you deserve it. Someone is dead because of you. Someone is dead because you were too scared to take a chance&#8212;to think for yourself for once in your life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Soon the streets start to clear out and the sun starts to set. You find yourself stumbling along the bank of the river, every muscle in your body exhausted from the heat and the walking. You can&#8217;t let yourself stop though. If you do, everything will catch up with you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You walk north along the river for hours, playing the same two images over and over in your head. You see Romeo&#8217;s eyes gazing up at you in the moonlight, brimming with everything the two of you could have shared. You see Benvolio&#8217;s eyes, overflowing with their sorrow and their accusations. You walk like this late into the night until your feet bleed and your vision blurs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You become delirious. Afraid of the eyes that won&#8217;t stop staring at you. Full of hope. Full of hatred. Full of hope. Full of hatred. At some point you fall. At some point you sense the river water engulfing every inch of your body. Part of you fights for air, fights for life, but another part of you knows that you don&#8217;t deserve it. That someone is dead because of you. That nothing you do will ever bring him back. That you&#8217;re tired. Your lungs fill with water, and you die imagining Romeo&#8217;s eyes.
