You draw your sword and yell back at Tybalt, telling him to leave you and your friend alone. Your swords clash through the air, and you feel yourself gaining momentum in the fight. You counter every strike Tybalt tries to make against you. You&#8217;re in a dead lock.

<p class="indent">
After several minutes of fighting, you start to tire. Tybalt continues to fight with fervor and intensity and you feel your energy level waning. You&#8217;re about to ask for a truce when Tybalt plunges his sword right into your belly.

You drop your sword and draw your hands to your stomach to feel the warmth gushing out of you. Your surroundings start to blur together. As you gasp for air in your final moments, you think of Juliet and the sweet smell of her hair.
