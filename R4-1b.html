You and Juliet decide to return to Verona to reunite with your families and explain the situation. You leave Juliet at her home and head towards yours.
</p>
<p class="indent">
As you turn the corner, you see Juliet&#8217;s cousin Tybalt arguing with your friend Mercutio. They both look rather worked up, and you approach them to figure out what&#8217;s going on. As soon as Tybalt notices you, he turns and directs all of his vitriol towards you. He calls you a villain and tells you to draw your sword.
