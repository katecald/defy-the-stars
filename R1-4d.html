You stay in Mantua, planning how you want to end your life. There is no point in living a life without Juliet. Just as you&#8217;re planning to go purchase poison from a local apothecary, a messenger from Friar Lawrence arrives with a letter for you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It&#8217;s written in Juliet&#8217;s hand, and it tells you of her convoluted plan to fake her own death in order to get out of her wedding to Paris. You cry tears of joy as you realize that Balthasar was misinformed. Juliet&#8217;s not actually dead. You rush to the Capulet&#8217;s tomb in Verona just as the letter instructs you too and you find Juliet awake in the tomb.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As you embrace you try to take in every inch of her. Her eyes, her lips, her hair, her scent. You kiss her and the two of you plan to run away to Mantua together.
