You push your way through the crowd of party-goers to make your way over to this entrancing girl. You feel drawn to her for some reason. You felt something like this with Rosaline, but there is something about this night that feels different. This girl looks up from her drink and locks eyes with you. You approach her, take her hand, and let words of adoration spill out of your mouth. You&#8217;re surprised when her responses are as quick and sweet as your own words.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You lean in to kiss her and as soon as your lips meet, you know that nothing about your life will ever be the same. Everything about her is soft and inviting. Even though it&#8217;s only your lips and your hands touching, you feel like she is pulling you closer, pulling you in. You want to close the distance between you and never look back. She is all you could ever need.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You kiss her again, and you forget where you are altogether. You exist only in this moment. You are only your hands and your lips. There is only you and her&#8212;Romeo and this girl whose name you don&#8217;t even know.
</p>
<p class="indent">
And then all of sudden, she&#8217;s pulling away from you. You take a step back to regain your balance and refocus your gaze on her, and you see that her nurse is pulling her away because her mother wishes to speak to her. The new love of your life disappears into the crowd, and you ask the nurse who the girl&#8217;s mother is.
</p>
<p class="indent">
&#8220;Her mother is the lady of the house,&#8221; the nurse responds. She seems a bit perplexed that you didn&#8217;t know this already.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You mumble your thanks and sink back into the crowds of the party. You are completely distraught. You stand in the midst of all of these people and curse your misfortunes. First Rosaline, and now this? This girl you&#8217;ve fallen for is Juliet Capulet? Are the fates destined to keep you alone for the rest of your life?
</p>
<p class="indent">
You&#8217;ve spent your whole life cultivating a simmering hatred towards the Capulets. They are a petty and cruel family. They&#8217;ve murdered members of your own family in cold blood, and you&#8217;ve seen what that&#8217;s done to your parents. But on the other hand, there is no way that this beautiful angel of a girl could have anything to do with those terrible acts.
