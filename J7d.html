You go into town to find Romeo. You made a mistake, and you want to make things right. As you run through the streets all the memories of the night you met him rush back into your head, and you regret every decision you&#8217;ve made recently.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Finally you find Benvolio, one of Romeo&#8217;s cousins. When you ask where Romeo is, he stares at you silently with a hatred so potent, you can feel yourself shrinking.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You repeat the question, barely louder than a whisper this time, and Benvolio spits out the answer.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Romeo is dead. He killed himself yesterday when he heard that you were marrying Paris.
You stumble backwards from him. You run until you can turn the corner, until you can escape the hatred in his eyes.
