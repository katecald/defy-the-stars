You crawl into bed and alternate between crying and sleeping for so many hours that you lose track of time completely. Your nurse and your mother come in periodically to check on you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
They give you some space for a week or so, thinking that you&#8217;re solely grieving Tybalt&#8217;s death. And though you are certainly upset that your favorite cousin has died, you&#8217;re also mourning the death of your relationship with Romeo. The death of the future you&#8217;d allowed yourself to imagine.

<p class="indent">
As time passes, you begin to emerge from your room more and more. You find yourself entertaining Paris with increasing regularity&#8212;your mother invites him over to your home often to make sure the two of you connect. Your conversations with him are fine. He&#8217;s an intelligent, successful man even if he does take a little too much pride in that fact.

Your parents decide you and Paris will wed the following week. Tybalt&#8217;s tragic death has reminded them that life is short and that not an hour can be wasted. On the day of your wedding, you find yourself thinking increasingly about Romeo. You remember how passionate Romeo&#8217;s words are when you speak to him. You didn&#8217;t know how unique that was before, but now that you&#8217;ve spent time with Paris, you realize that Romeo&#8217;s passion is not something everyone possesses.
