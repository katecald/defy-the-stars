You ignore these lingering thoughts of Romeo. They&#8217;re probably only pre-wedding jitters anyways. You wed Paris in front of both of your families. You look into Paris&#8217; eyes as Friar Lawrence reads from the Bible, and you can see that he cares for you&#8212;that he wants to make sure you&#8217;re never in need of anything. When you lean in to kiss him after promising to spend your lives together, you are surprised by the warmth of his lips on yours.
</p>
 
<p class="indent">
You have three children together and you spend your days raising them with the help of your nurse. You do live a comfortable life. There is always food on the table and dresses for your two daughters and trousers for your son.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You hear through your nurse that Romeo married someone named Marianne whom you never heard of. Sometimes you see Romeo and Marianne in the marketplace. You can tell from the hatred in Romeo&#8217;s eyes that he holds a grudge against you for sending him away that night he scaled the wall of your garden. Sometimes you wonder what would have been if you&#8217;d lingered with him in the moonlight. But then you remember the glares he gives you whenever you cross paths and you remember that he&#8217;s a Montague. Your family has always told you how Montagues are an angry, vengeful family, and now you have more evidence to back up that truth.
