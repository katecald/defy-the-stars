You marry Juliet in Friar Lawrence&#8217;s cell the next day. As you speak the words aloud that bind you to Juliet for life, you can hear the harmony and the poetry in them. It&#8217;s as if both of your promises are intertwining to create one beautiful stream of music.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The music of your love plays in your head throughout the rest of your day. You and Juliet separate after a long embrace in Friar Lawrence&#8217;s cell. Her nurse is going to set out a ladder for you to climb so that you can spend your first night together as husband and wife.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You spend the afternoon walking along the streets, barely able to handle your excitement for the evening. You want to spend the rest of your life making music with Juliet, and you want to start now.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As you turn the corner, you see Juliet&#8217;s cousin Tybalt arguing with your friend Mercutio. They both look rather worked up, and you approach them to figure out what&#8217;s going on. As soon as Tybalt notices you, he turns and directs all of his vitriol towards you. He calls you a villain and tells you to draw your sword.
