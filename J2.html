You continue your conversation with Paris and it&#8217;s not long before your parents make their way across the room and join in. They speak with such a concentrated excitement about you and Paris that you find yourself feeling a bit overwhelmed. When they start mentioning wedding dates, you can feel your vision start to close in, but then you remind yourself that these are your parents. They know what&#8217;s best for you. They&#8217;ve never led your wrong before.

<p class="noindent">
You wed Paris the following week in front of both of your families. You look into Paris&#8217; eyes as Friar Lawrence reads from the Bible, and you can see that he cares for you&#8212;that he wants to make sure you&#8217;re never in need of anything. When you lean in to kiss him after promising to spend your lives together, you are surprised by the warmth of his lips on yours. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
You have three children together and you spend your days raising them with the help of your nurse. You do live a comfortable life. There is always food on the table and dresses for your two daughters and trousers for your son.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You grow to love Paris because of all he does for you. He becomes a comfortable companion&#8212;someone who is always there for you. And you never find yourself wanting more.
