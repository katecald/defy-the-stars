You take a deep breath and agree to marry Paris. Your parents are overjoyed and rush over to hug you. You spend the night tossing and turning, imagining hundreds of scenarios and schemes to get out of marrying Paris. Your stomach is knotted and you have a hard time breathing. You wish Romeo were here beside you, but you know that cannot be because he has been banished from Verona. He&#8217;s waiting for you in Mantua.
</p>
<p class="indent">
The next day you speak with Paris for the first time. His words are confident, like Romeo&#8217;s, but they&#8217;re somehow empty. Whenever Paris speaks of his love for you and his excitement to wed you, you feel nothing. As the conversation drags on, you consider your options. You could run away after this conversation with Paris and go meet Romeo in Mantua. But there&#8217;s always the chance your family would come looking for you if you did that. You could fake your own death right before your impending wedding to Paris. If you did that, your family would have a chance to say goodbye, and you could sneak off to Mantua without the chance of anyone coming to look for you. Finally, Paris wraps up his visit and leaves you alone.
