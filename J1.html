You refuse to leave Romeo&#8217;s side. Friar Lawrence pleads with you for a moment longer before leaving you alone. You wrap your arms around Romeo&#8217;s limp body, and your sobs come harder and faster as you feel his flesh getting colder and colder by the second. You think of what it was like to be held by his warm, strong arms, and you feel everything inside you break as you realize that you will never feel Romeo&#8217;s arms around you again.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After a while your sobs quiet down and you notice Romeo&#8217;s dagger lying beside him. You pick it up and feel its weight in your hands. If there is even a slim chance that dying will bring you and Romeo back together again, it&#8217;s worth taking.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You hold the dagger aloft with both hands before plunging it deep into your belly. Your vision goes fuzzy as you watch your blood pour onto the stone floor. You die next to Romeo, thinking of how the moon glimmered in his eyes at he gazed up at you from the garden and the way his lips had a way of warming your whole body and the night you spent stroking his hair as you watched him fall asleep.
