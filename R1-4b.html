<p class="noindent">
You stumble through the streets of Verona, covered in Mercutio&#8217;s blood. You climb the Capulet&#8217;s wall and yell up at Juliet from the garden. She comes out to see what&#8217;s happening and screams when she sees you. She runs down to the garden and holds you in her arms.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You cry as you tell her about the fight. About how Tybalt tried to provoke you. How you refused to engage because he is a member of your own family now. How Mercutio stood up and fought for you only to die. How you held the dying Mercutio in your arms while he cursed both your families for doing this to him.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When you are done explaining, she takes your face in her hands and says that you an honorable man. That you did everything you could to avoid the conflict. That she loves you more than anything in the world. She kisses away the tears that are streaming down your face before making your way down towards your lips.
</p>

<p class="indent">
She takes you into her home and cleans you up. Her family is outraged and confused by her. They pepper her with questions and accusations. Why are you helping this filthy Montague? Where is your sense of loyalty?
</p>

<p class="indent">
She yells at her parents about the futility of their feud with the Montagues. She takes your hand in hers and tells them that she has married Romeo Montague, that she loves Romeo Montague, that she is going to spend the rest of her life with Romeo Montague.
</p>

<p class="indent">
She takes you by the hand and pulls you out of that home, you flee together to Mantua.
