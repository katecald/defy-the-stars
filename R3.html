You kneel down under this olive tree with Rosaline&#8217;s hand in yours and ask her if she will spend the rest of her life with you. You tell her again that you are sure the fates desire for the two of you to be together. That you are sure this is the truest love anyone could wish to experience. Tears come to her eyes as she proclaims that she will marry you. You embrace under the olive tree.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You&#8217;re married by the end of the month. You have three children together, and anytime you find yourselves at a party, you hold hands and spin together the story of you met and how you pursued her relentlessly and how she finally agreed to be you wife that fateful July day under the olive tree. It becomes a classic story in the town of Verona, and many people ask you to recount it for them, again and again.
