You leave the Capulets' house and head to the orchard you spent the morning in. You kick apples around in the dark and think back over every moment you and Rosaline have spent together. You think of her dark, gleaming hair and the way her eyes crinkle when she smiles.
</p>


<p class="indent">
How could the fates be so cruel as to keep the two of you apart? You try to imagine a life without Rosaline, but without her everything is meaningless. The life that stretches before you is callous and bare. It&#8217;s not a life that you want to live.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You find some rope coiled at the base of one of the apple trees. You tie it around the strongest branch you can find before looping a noose around your neck.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You cry out at the stars one last time before letting the weight of your body take you to a place where you don&#8217;t have to experience the cruelty of fate anymore.
