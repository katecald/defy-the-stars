You stand and draw your sword, fueled by your anger. It makes no sense to you that Mercutio should be dead while Tybalt, a murderer, lives.
</p>

 
<p class="indent">
You fight him and it only takes a few moments before Tybalt leaves his torso unprotected, and you lunge forward for the kill. After you plunge your sword into Tybalt, everything goes a little fuzzy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You can tell there&#8217;s a crowd congregating around you, and you can see the Prince of Verona approaching to figure out what all of the noise is about. Benvolio pulls you up from the ground and tells you to run.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So you do. You run away from the death and the chaos. You run until your legs and your lungs are burning. You run until you reach Friar Lawrence&#8217;s cell.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You spend the rest of the day awaiting news from Juliet. You are distraught at the idea that your rash actions might ruin the love the two of you have for each other. Finally, Juliet&#8217;s nurse comes to visit. She tells you that Juliet plans to remain faithful to you, and you collapse onto the ground in relief. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Friar Lawrence and Juliet&#8217;s nurse concoct a scheme that allows you and Juliet to see each other tonight before you have to flee to Mantua. They figure that you should stay out of Verona until the madness dies down.
