You leave to gather your things and come back to Juliet&#8217;s garden. The two of you sneak off to Mantua in the dead of night and are married in the morning.
</p>


<p class="indent">
As you speak the words aloud that bind you to Juliet for life, you can hear the harmony and the poetry in them. It&#8217;s as if both of your promises are intertwining to create one beautiful stream of music.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The music of your love plays in your head throughout the rest of your day. You spend your first night together as husband and wife. You remember how your marriage vows wove together to create the beautiful music of your love, and now you find that your hands and your lips are working together to create a whole new type of music. It is a symphony that swells and slows. You want to spend the rest of your life awash in this music.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On your seventh morning in Mantua, the rays of the dawn wake you, and you kiss Juliet to wake her up. Soon you start having a conversation about your options. Although you both miss your families, you know that they would have an almost impossible time understanding your decision to get married without their approval.
