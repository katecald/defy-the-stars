You watch this boy push his way through the crowd of party-goers. When he reaches you, he takes your hand in his and speaks to you in a way you&#8217;ve never experienced in your life. His words are flattering and as sweet as honey, but his wit is quick. You find yourself responding to his playful words from a deep, intuitive place you&#8217;ve never accessed before. Your words seem to fit together with his somehow:
</p>

<p class="indent">
He leans in to kiss you and as soon as your lips meet, you know that nothing about your life will ever be the same. Even though it&#8217;s only your lips and hands touching, you feel every part of your body reaching towards him the way wild flowers stretch towards the sun.
He kisses you again, and you forget where you are altogether. You exist only in this moment. You are only your hands and your lips. There is only you and him&#8212;Juliet and this boy whose name you don&#8217;t even know.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Your nurse interrupts to tell you that your mother wishes to speak to you. You&#8217;ve never been more annoyed by your nurse in your life (which is saying something because she can be quite a talkative, clueless woman). You pull away from this boy and already begin imagining the next time you will see him.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You go looking for your mother in the other room, but you can&#8217;t spot her. Your nurse comes to catch up with you and you ask her if she knows who the boy was. She says she doesn&#8217;t, but she can find out. You watch her weave her way into the crowd, still annoyed by her interruption but pleased that she can gather this information for you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When she returns, you can tell from her eyes that she has a juicy bit of information.
&#8220;He&#8217;s Romeo Montague,&#8221; she whispers, &#8220;the only son of your great enemy.&#8221;
</p>

<br/>

<p class="indent">
Later that night after the feast has ended,  you stand out on your balcony to have a moment alone. Your stomach has been in knots ever since you discovered that the boy you connected with on such a deep level was none other than Romeo Montague.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By no means do you want to disobey your family by pursuing a relationship with their enemy. You love your parents and they&#8217;ve always treated you well. Even if they haven&#8217;t always been the most involved, they&#8217;ve always wanted what&#8217;s best for you, and you want to respect their wishes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You look up at the moon and start to speak your thoughts aloud. Why must Romeo be a Montague? You&#8217;ve never met anyone like him&#8212;a person you want to learn everything about, a person you want to fall asleep talking to, a person you want to wake up next to in the morning and kiss. You don&#8217;t even know why this foolish feud between your families exists. It&#8217;s always been this way and no one ever talks about it. If Romeo wasn&#8217;t Romeo, he would be absolutely perfect for you. You would declare your desire to marry him immediately.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Suddenly a voice interrupts your verbalized thoughts from the garden below. You scream and jump backwards. Your balcony is your private place to think, and now some hoodlum lurking in the dark is ruining your moment. You squint and realize that it&#8217;s Romeo who stands below your balcony. You are simultaneously ecstatic and terrified. On the one hand, you&#8217;ve been imagining when you would see him again from the instant he kissed you. On the other, he broke into your home and you&#8217;re afraid that your parents will hear him yelling up at you from the garden in the middle of the night.
