You yell at your parents that you&#8217;ve married Romeo Montague, that you love Romeo Montague, that you are going to spend the rest of your life with Romeo Montague. They are completely shocked by your outburst, and they don&#8217;t quite believe you. As you start to gather your things, they start to gather their wits and all of a sudden they&#8217;re peppering you with questions.

<p class="indent">
You walk out of room, out of their home, out of their life without answering them. All you need right now is Romeo. You go find him and the two of you take off to Mantua that night.
