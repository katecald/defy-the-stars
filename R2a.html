You walk out towards the garden and find Rosaline there, looking out at the flowers and the herbs. You take her hands in yours and declare your love for her yet again.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You tell her that you know she intends to live a life of chastity and you want to respect her wishes, but something in the stars keeps pulling the two of you together. You tell her that you will do everything in your power to make her the happiest woman in the world. You tell her that there is nothing you want more than you spend your days beside her, talking and laughing and kissing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
She pulls her hands away from yours and says that she has made her vow of chastity and that she&#8217;s sticking to it. She says that you seem like a sweet boy, but you shouldn&#8217;t speak to her anymore. She leaves the garden to reenter the party.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You yell up at the stars and ask them how they could let this happen&#8212;how Rosaline could be so blind to the fact that the two of you are destined to be together. Eventually you tire yourself out.
