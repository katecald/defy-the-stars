You tell Tybalt that you have no interest in fighting with him. He has no way of knowing that you married into his family only hours ago, but you assure him that you love him and his family in a way that he doesn&#8217;t understand.
</p>

<p class="indent">
No matter how much you try reason with him, Tybalt only ends up being more worked up by your placating language. Mercutio steps in front of you and draws his sword, calling your attempts at keeping the peace dishonorable. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
You plead with them to put their swords away, but they lunge at each other and start fighting. You watch in terror as their swords slice through the air, clanging against each other and narrowly missing vital organs. They yell taunts at each other, treating this death match like a game, until Tybalt stabs Mercutio straight through the gut.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You rush forward and try to tend to Mercutio. He curses the feud between the Montagues and Capulets before surrendering to death in your arms.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You look up to see Tybalt standing above the two of you, gloating in triumph. He&#8217;s pleased that your best friend is dead. He&#8217;s pleased that he is the one who killed him.
