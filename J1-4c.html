You agree to go to Mantua with Romeo before hungrily leaning in to kiss him more. The two of you pack your things and leave together that night.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You spend a whole week together, enjoying the beginning of your lifetime as husband and wife. It&#8217;s more than you could have ever imagined. You feel that same combination of ecstasy and fear you did when Romeo appeared in your garden in the moonlight only a few days ago. Everything is new, and everything is wonderful. Whenever you lay beside Romeo, watching him drift off to sleep, you smile softly as you realize that you will get to fall asleep beside him and wake up next to him for the rest of your life. You succumb to sleep knowing that nothing you dream could even attempt to live up to the real life dream you find yourself living now, here with Romeo.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the seventh morning, the rays of the dawn wake you and you flutter your eyelids open to see Romeo beaming at you. You kiss him before beginning to discuss your options. Although you both miss your families, you know that they would have an almost impossible time understanding your decision to get married without their approval. Romeo thinks you both should stay in Mantua and build a new life there, but he also says that whatever you choose is his choice as well. You&#8217;re conflicted because the idea of leaving your family behind is troubling to you.
