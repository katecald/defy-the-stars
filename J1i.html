You meet with Friar Lawrence and develop a plan for a clean getaway. He gives you a sleeping potion and instructs you to take it right before your wedding to Paris. He agrees to send word to Romeo in Mantua of this plan so that Romeo can come and fetch you when you wake up from the potion. Then you and Romeo will be free to live out the rest of your days in Mantua&#8212;free from any prying eyes or senseless rivalries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You take the potion as planned before your wedding. As your eyelids grow heavy, you imagine how wonderful it will be to awake to Romeo&#8217;s loving gaze. How wonderful it will be to start your new life together, completely free from all of the hardship and struggle that you&#8217;ve had to undergo so far.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When you wake up from you drug-induced sleep, you don&#8217;t see Romeo&#8217;s face right away. Just the cold stone ceiling of the tomb. You stretched and roll over to your left only to discover Romeo&#8217;s lifeless body beside you. You scream. You shake him and whisper his name. You kiss his lips over and over, but they do not respond in that loving, reciprocal way you&#8217;ve come to expect. It&#8217;s only then you notice the vial in his right hand. Poison. Romeo&#8212;your love, your life&#8212;is dead by poison.

Friar Lawrence comes in and tells you that both Romeo and Paris are dead. That the plan has gone horribly awry. He begs you to come with him before the watch hears them and enters the tomb.
