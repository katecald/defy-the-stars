You tell Paris to leave you alone. You tell him that enough blood has been shed and that you are already completely distraught, but he refuses to leave.
</p>
<p class="indent">
He comes at you, sword drawn, and you draw your sword to defend yourself. You end up killing Paris in battle, but it doesn&#8217;t matter. Nothing matters anymore. So many people have died for nothing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You drag Paris&#8217;s body into the tomb, and you see Juliet lying there, hands folded neatly across her heart. She is every bit as heavenly as you remembered her to be. Even in death, she looks alive and vivacious. Her cheeks still have color in them, and her hair still has the same sweet smell to it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You lay beside her and take out the poison you purchased from the apothecary.
