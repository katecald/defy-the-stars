You&#8217;re walking through an orchard on the outskirts of Verona, kicking rotten apples across the dirt. It&#8217;s a muggy July morning. The sweat drips down your neck as you let your thoughts run through your head.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You met a woman named Rosaline last week whom you would like to wed. She&#8217;s more beautiful than anyone you&#8217;ve ever met, but when you declared your love for her, she told you she was planning to live a life of chastity. You&#8217;ve never heard of such a cruel and unfair decision. Such beauty should not go to waste.
</p>
<p class="indent">
After spending a few hours stewing about Rosaline, you head back into town. The sun is gaining intensity as it gets higher in the sky. You see your cousin Benvolio on the street. When he asks you what&#8217;s wrong, you bemoan Rosaline&#8217;s vow of chastity. He nods in understanding, and the two of you start to walk towards your home.
</p>
<p class="indent">
On the way, you pass a Capulet servant reading a guest list aloud for the feast they are hosting that night. Your ears perk up at the mention of Rosaline&#8217;s name.
You turn to Benvolio in excitement. This is a sign you and Rosaline are meant to be together. Why else would you have happened to walk by this servant at this <i>exact</i> moment. Benvolio is doubtful, but you persist. All you have to decide now is how to receive this sign from the universe.

<p class="choice"><a href="R1_2.html">Do you wait for the Capulet feast tonight?</a></p>
