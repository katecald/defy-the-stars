You return to Verona and walk into your home hand-in-hand with Romeo. Your nurse and your parents gather to greet you. They are relieved that you are alive and well, but once they realize that you are holding hands with a Montague, their eyes start to fill with suspicion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You tell your family that you&#8217;ve married Romeo Montague, that you love Romeo Montague, that you are going to spend the rest of your life with Romeo Montague. They are completely shocked, and they don&#8217;t quite believe you. As you start to gather your things, they start to gather their wits and all of a sudden they&#8217;re peppering you with questions.
</p>
 
<p class="indent">
You walk out of room, out of their home, out of their life without answering them. All you need right now is Romeo.
