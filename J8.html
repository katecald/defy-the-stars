You make your way home, but you feel like every organ in your body has been extracted. There is nothing inside you, but the hollowness somehow feels like it&#8217;s bursting out of you. An overflow of emptiness. An abundance of nothing. Someone is dead because of you. Someone is dead because you were too scared to take a chance&#8212;to think for yourself for once in your life.

Your nurse comes to your room to prepare you for your wedding. She can tell that there is something seriously wrong with you, but you just let her prattle away and ask questions as she dresses you. You have nothing to say to her. There is nothing.

Vowing to spend your life with Paris is surprisingly easy. You repeat the words Friar Lawrence says without any problem because they don&#8217;t mean anything to you. The hardest part is looking into Paris&#8217;s eyes. Because when you do, you don&#8217;t see Paris&#8217;s eyes. You see Romeo&#8217;s eyes gazing up at you in the moonlight, brimming with everything the two of you could have shared. You see Benvolio&#8217;s eyes, overflowing with sorrow and accusations.

But you get through the wedding. You smile and you say what everyone wants you to say and you feel nothing. And that&#8217;s the same way you get through the rest of the week, and the next year, and the rest of your life. With empty smiles and a heart full of nothing.
