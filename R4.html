<p class="noindent">
Ultimately you and Juliet decide that the best thing to do is to maintain some distance from your families as you begin your life together. You both send word that you are alive and well in Mantua, living out your married life together. You continue to write letters to your families in which you explain how excited and energized you both are, having found each other, and that you hope they can be happy for you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Over the next few weeks, you hear word of lots of skirmishes happening back in Verona. Montagues and Capulets fighting in the streets, threats being made, daggers being drawn. You and Juliet are worried for your families&#8217; safety, but you stand by your decision to be together. After all, it&#8217;s your families&#8217; choices to uphold this feud that&#8217;s causing the danger in Verona, not yours and Juliet&#8217;s choice to stay together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Over the next few months, the high tensions settle down and your families each travel separately to Mantua to visit you both. Things are cold and awkward at first, but over time, your families adjust to the reality that you and Juliet love each other immensely.

When Juliet gives birth to your first child, both your mother and her mother are in the room. Something about your son&#8217;s face melts away the lingering animosity between your mothers and allows them to pave the way for your families to reconcile. You and Juliet move back to Verona with your son in tow, and you have three more children that Juliet&#8217;s nurse and both of your families help you raise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You spend your life making beautiful music with Juliet, adding on with different layers and instruments. She is the love of your life, and you thank your lucky stars that you found her.
