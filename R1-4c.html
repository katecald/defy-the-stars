You hold the poison in your hand and lay beside Juliet. It&#8217;s almost as if fate is mocking you&#8212;her body still feels warm and full of life.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Finally you sit up and uncork the poison. You&#8217;re about to bring it to your lips when you feel movement beside you. You call out Juliet&#8217;s name in wonderment.
Her eyes flutter open, and she smiles beatifically up at you. You hands start to shake and you drop the vial of poison onto the floor. Are you hallucinating? This can&#8217;t possibly be happening.
</p>
<p class="indent">
When Juliet climbs into your lap and kisses you, you start to believe that this is real. That these really are her soft lips kissing you and her sweet hair tickling your cheek. When you finally pull apart, Juliet explains how uncompromising her parents were about marrying her off to Paris. She refers to a letter she sent you, and you stop her, explaining that you never received a letter. Her face pales as you tell her that you thought she was really dead. That you came here to kill yourself. That the vial of poison that has spilled across the floor was intended to end your life.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Juliet weeps in your arms, and you hold her. You stroke her hair and tell her that everything is going to be all right.
