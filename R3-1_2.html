You go to Rosaline&#8217;s home, but her servants tell you she&#8217;s not there. When you ask about where she is, they are vague and unhelpful. You&#8217;ve spoken to them before when you&#8217;ve called on Rosaline throughout the last week, and they seem to be tiring of your constant presence. You thank them for their time, and go to your home to get ready for the party.
