Ultimately you and Romeo decide that the best thing to do is to maintain some distance from your families as you begin your life together. You both send word to your families that you are alive and well, living out your married life together. You continue to write letters to your families in which you explain how excited and energized you both are, having found each other, and that you hope they can be happy for you.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Over the next few weeks, you hear word of lots of skirmishes happening back in Verona. Montagues and Capulets fighting in the streets, daggers being drawn, threats being made. You and Romeo are worried for your families&#8217; safety, but you stand by your decision to be together. After all, it&#8217;s your families&#8217; choices to uphold this feud that&#8217;s causing the danger in Verona, not yours and Romeo&#8217;s choice to stay together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Over the next few months, the high tensions settle down and your families each travel separately to Mantua to visit you both. Things are cold and awkward at first, but over time, your families adjust to the reality that you and Romeo love each immensely.

When you give birth to your first child, both your mother and Romeo&#8217;s mother are in the room. Something about your son&#8217;s face melts away the lingering animosity between your mothers and allows them to pave the way for your families to reconcile. You and Romeo move back to Verona with your son in tow, and you have three more children with Romeo that your nurse and both of your families help you raise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Through all the years you spend falling asleep next to Romeo, you never tire of waking up to him. His passion inspires you every day of your life, and you see his passion in every one of your children.
