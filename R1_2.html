You arrive at the Capulets’ home when the feast is already in full swing. There are so many guests, you realize you’re going to have a hard time finding Rosaline. You weave through the crowd, keeping an eye out for her dark hair and mysterious eyes. Your cheeks grow flushed in anticipation of finding her.

As you continue looking for Rosaline, you spot a different girl you’ve never seen before. She’s standing by the feast spread looking a little bored. She is fair and delicate, and there is something about her that draws you in. She has an aura of confidence. She’s also extremely beautiful.
