You stand on your balcony looking down at Romeo&#8217;s face, which is glowing in the moonlight. You ask him how he got into the garden and what he&#8217;s doing here. He responds in the manner you&#8217;re learning to expect from him: poetic words pour forth from his mouth as he elaborates on his deep and undying love that will endure any trials and hardships that come between you.

<p class="indent">
You try to keep your head straight. His words are intoxicating and you&#8217;re tempted to drink them in without a second thought. But then you remember that there are legitimate reasons that you shouldn&#8217;t be together, reasons you shouldn&#8217;t even be speaking right now. You voice these concerns: that this is all happening so fast, that it shouldn&#8217;t be happening, that you both should probably take some time to think this through, but every cautionary word you offer is countered with a lyrical declaration of his devotion to you.
