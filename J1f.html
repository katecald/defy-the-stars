When your nurse arrives at your room with Romeo, you both look at each other for a split second before falling into each other&#8217;s arms. Romeo cries as he tells you about the fight. About how Tybalt tried to provoke him. How he refused to engage. How Mercutio stood up and fought for him only to die. How Romeo had no choice but to avenge this senseless murder.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You hold him in your arms and listen to him. You&#8217;re relieved that Romeo didn&#8217;t initiate the fight, but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Tybalt is dead&#8212;that Romeo killed him. Romeo finishes his story and looks up at you through his bleary eyes, waiting for you to respond.

<p class="choice"><a href="J1g.html">Do you tell him that you understand and that you forgive him?</a></p>
<p class="choice"><a href="J5g.html">Do you tell him that you can&#8217;t be with someone who killed a member of your family and send him away?</a></p>
