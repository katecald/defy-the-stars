Tears roll down your cheeks as you say that you understand. That you forgive him. That he did all he could to avoid a conflict. That you love him more than anything in the world. Romeo kisses the tears from your cheeks before making his way to your mouth. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
You bring him to your bed and spend your first night together as husband and wife. It&#8217;s more than you could have ever imagined. You feel that same combination of ecstasy and fear you did when Romeo appeared in your garden in the moonlight only two days ago. Everything is new, and everything is wonderful. As you watch Romeo drift off to sleep, you smile softly as you realize that you will get to fall asleep beside him and wake up next to him for the rest of your life. You succumb to sleep knowing that nothing you dream tonight could even attempt to live up to the real life dream you find yourself living now, here with Romeo.

<p class="indent">
The rays of the dawn wake you and you flutter your eyelids open to see Romeo beaming at you. You kiss him and he prepares to sneak out of your window. There will come a time for you parents to find out about your new husband, but this morning is not that time. Romeo must flee Verona because the Prince has ordered him banished in light of the whole situation with Tybalt.

That afternoon your parents come into your room to talk to you about Paris. Even though you haven&#8217;t even had a real conversation with the man, they&#8217;ve decided you should marry him immediately. Tybalt&#8217;s tragic death has reminded them that life is short and that not an hour can be wasted. You are appalled by their haste and their lack of concern for your wishes. You fight with them and state your refusal to marry Paris. They are shocked by you, and for good reason: you&#8217;ve never directly defied them in your life.

<p class="indent">
As the argument builds you realize you have two choices two ways to get out of this.

<p class="choice"><a href="J1-4b.html">Do you tell your parents the truth about your marriage to Romeo?</a></p>
<p class="choice"><a href="J1h.html">Do you pretend to agree to marry Paris in the hopes of sneaking away with Romeo later?</a></p>
