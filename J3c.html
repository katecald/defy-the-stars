You apologize to Romeo, saying it&#8217;s far too late to be talking, and you retreat back into your room. You feel conflicted about leaving the balcony, but it&#8217;s the middle of the night and he broke into your family&#8217;s home.
</p>
 
<p class="indent">
The next morning, when you wake up, you feel less conflicted about your decision. The whole memory feels almost surreal, like something you dreamt overnight. The idea of this boy, the son of your family&#8217;s sworn enemy, showing up in your garden in the wee hours of the morning and yelling up at you feels absurd. You shrug it off and move on with your day.

You spend the next few days entertaining Paris with increasing regularity&#8212;your mother invites him over to your home often to make sure the two of you connect. Your conversations with him are fine. He&#8217;s an intelligent, successful man even if he does take a little too much pride in that fact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Your parents decide you and Paris will wed the following week. On the day of your wedding, you find yourself thinking increasingly about Romeo and how fervent he was when he spoke to you. You didn&#8217;t know how unique that was before, but now that you&#8217;ve spent time with Paris, you realize that Romeo&#8217;s passion is not something everyone possesses.
