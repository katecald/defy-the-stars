You find Rosaline looking at some silks in the town square with her servant. You stand smiling at her from afar for a moment before approaching. Her raven hair gleams in the sunlight, and you find your lips curling to match her smile.
</p>
<p class="indent">
You ask to speak to her for a moment alone. She is surprised to see you here, but she agrees. You lead her under the shade of an olive tree and take her hand in yours. You tell her that you know she intends to live a life of chastity and you want to respect her wishes, but something in the stars keeps pulling the two of you together. You tell her that you will do everything in your power to make her the happiest woman in the world. You tell her that there is nothing you want more than you spend your days beside her, talking and laughing and kissing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
She blushes and says that you weave together a convincing argument.
