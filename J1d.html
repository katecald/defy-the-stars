You stay on the balcony and let his passionate words wash over you. This connection is something worth fighting for. You&#8217;ve never experienced anything like it, and you don&#8217;t know if you ever will again. You decide that you will wed the next day. You promise to send your nurse to him in the morning so you can figure out the logistics. Even though this is happening so quickly, you believe in it completely. Even in your wildest day dreams, you never could have imagined a love like this.

You marry Romeo in Friar Lawrence&#8217;s cell the next day. As you promise your life to Romeo, you have glimpses of what that life will look like. You imagine Sunday afternoons curled into his side while you read and long summer evenings holding his hand as you walk the streets of Verona. There&#8217;s a voice in the back of your head telling you that all of these visions are very improbable given the tension between your families. But you ignore that voice for now because none of that matters as much as the feeling you get when you look into his eyes. The feeling that tells you that against all odds, everything will be all right.

After the ceremony, Romeo talks to you about taking a trip to Mantua, a town nearby. He pleads with you, saying that all he wants is you and that you are enough for him. He takes you into his arms and kisses you and you have a hard time thinking of any reason not to sneak away with him to Mantua. Then the voice in the back of your head pipes up and reminds you how furious your parents would be if you left for Mantua without telling them anything, especially if they figured out that you secretly married Romeo without their consent.

You pull away from Romeo to clear your head. On the one hand, it would be absolutely marvelous to spend some time alone with your new husband in Mantua. On the other, it would be much more mature to stay in Verona and figure out how your new married life will work in the long term.
