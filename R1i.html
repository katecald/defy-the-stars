You purchase poison from an apothecary and head back to Verona. You go straight to the tomb where Juliet&#8217;s body is so that you can look upon her face when you leave this cruel world.
</p>
<p class="indent">
As you&#8217;re breaking into the tomb, you hear someone sneaking up behind you. It&#8217;s Paris, the man Juliet&#8217;s parents were always encouraging her to marry. He starts yelling at you, accusing you of all sorts of terrible things. He blames you for Juliet&#8217;s death, saying she died grieving the loss of her cousin Tybalt. He tells you that you deserve to die. If only he knew how much you agreed with him.

Paris demands a fight.
