You leave the tomb with Friar Lawrence. He takes you home to your family, and they are overjoyed by the miracle that you are alive. You let them hug you, but you can&#8217;t help but notice that it feels like every organ in your body has been extracted. There is nothing inside you, but the hollowness somehow feels like it&#8217;s bursting out of you. An overflow of emptiness. An abundance of nothing. Someone you loved is dead because of you. Someone is dead because you were too scared to take a chance&#8212;to think for yourself for once in your life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You parents give you a bit of space before trying to find new suitors for you. They think you&#8217;re mourning Paris&#8217;s death at the hands of that bloody, violent Romeo Montague. Little do they know the reason you have nothing left inside you is because every fiber of life died with that filthy Montague boy, Romeo. Your Romeo.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Eventually your parents introduce you to a man named Antonio. You feel towards the same things you felt towards Paris&#8212;resignation and acceptance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the day of your wedding to Antonio, your nurse comes to your room to prepare you for your wedding. She can tell that there is something seriously wrong with you, that something&#8217;s been wrong for a while, but you just let her prattle away and ask questions as she dresses you. You have nothing to say to her. There is nothing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Vowing to spend your life with Antonio is surprisingly easy. You repeat the words Friar Lawrence says without any problem because they don&#8217;t mean anything to you. The hardest part is looking into Antonio&#8217;s eyes. Because when you do, you don&#8217;t see Antonio&#8217;s eyes. You see Romeo&#8217;s eyes gazing up at you in the moonlight, brimming with everything the two of you could have shared. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
But you get through the wedding. You smile and you say what everyone wants you to say and you feel nothing. And that&#8217;s the same way you get through the rest of the week, and the next year, and the rest of your life. With empty smiles and a heart full of nothing.
