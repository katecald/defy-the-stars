That night, you sneak into Juliet&#8217;s room. You look at each other for only a moment before falling into each other&#8217;s arms. You cry as you tell her about the fight. About how Tybalt tried to provoke you. How you refused to engage because he is a member of your own family now. How Mercutio stood up and fought for you only to die. How you avenged that senseless murder.

She holds you in her and arms and listens to you explain. And when you are done explaining, she takes your face in her hands and says that she forgives you. That you did everything you could to avoid the conflict. That she loves you more than anything in the world. You kiss away the tears that are forming in the corners of her eyes before making your way down towards her soft, warm lips.
</p>

She brings you to her bed and you spend your first night together as husband and wife. You remember how your vows wove together in Friar Lawrence&#8217;s cell to create the beautiful music of your love, and now you find that your hands and your lips are working together to create a whole new type of music. It is a symphony that swells and slows. You want to spend the rest of your life awash in this music.

When the rays of the dawn wake you, you kiss Juliet. She promises that you will find a way to be together again, and you embrace. You smell the sweet scent of her hair one last time before climbing out the window.

You spend a few days in Mantua, awaiting word from Juliet. Finally, your servant Balthasar comes to visit you. You ask Balthasar about Juliet, and he tells you that Juliet was found dead this morning in her bedroom. You press him for more information, but that&#8217;s all he knows. You are completely distraught. The only thing that seems to make sense to you is to end your life beside the one you love.
