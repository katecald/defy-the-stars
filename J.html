You&#8217;re sitting in your room with your nurse. It&#8217;s a hot July day&#8212;the kind that causes sweat to collect where your hairline meets the back of your neck before trickling down towards your dress.

<p class="indent">
Your family is throwing a feast in a few hours, and while you&#8217;re looking forward to seeing your cousin, Tybalt, and some of your other extended family, you&#8217;re not particularly excited about the feast. You&#8217;ve reached the age where people&#8217;s questions at such parties are mainly &#8220;Who are you looking to wed?&#8221; and &#8220;When do you think you&#8217;ll be married?&#8221; Since you don&#8217;t have answers yet, you&#8217;re not looking forward to fielding the same questions dozens of times.

Your mother comes into the room and tells you about Paris, a man who will be attending the feast tonight. She asks you to keep an eye out for him, and you give her your word that you will spend some time talking with him to see if you&#8217;d like him to pursue you. Your answer pleases your mother and she leaves you to continue getting ready for the party with your nurse.

A few hours later, when there are a decent amount of guests downstairs for the feast, you enter down the main staircase with your father and make the rounds. You smile demurely as he plays the role of the jovial host. This is a routine you&#8217;re used to at this point&#8212;it&#8217;s second nature. After several polite conversations, you finally catch a moment to yourself near the food. Out of the corner of your eye, you see Paris in the next room speaking with one of your uncles. You know you should probably approach him since your mother asked you to earlier this afternoon. Just as you&#8217;re about to make your way towards Paris, however, you notice an eager, red-faced boy around your age making a beeline for you. You&#8217;ve never met him before, but he looks very intent on talking to you.
