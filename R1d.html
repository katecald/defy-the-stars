You sneak around the back of the Capulet&#8217;s house after the feast has wound down and climb over the wall into their garden. You can hear Benvolio and your friend Mercutio looking for you, but you stay silent behind the wall. Mercutio does an imitation of you proclaiming your love for Rosaline. You shake your head and smile. Rosaline is a thing of the past. Juliet is your future.
</p>


<p class="indent">
You glance up at the balcony over looking the garden, and you&#8217;re shocked to find Juliet looking up at the moonlight. You start to approach her slowly, overwhelmed and awed by how beautiful she looks.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Suddenly she starts to speak aloud. It&#8217;s as if she&#8217;s asking the moon for counsel. She laments the fact that you are a Montague. She says that she&#8217;s never met anyone like you&#8212;a person she wants to learn everything about, a person she wants to fall asleep talking to, a person she wants to wake up next to in the morning and kiss. She doesn&#8217;t even know why this foolish feud between your families exists. It&#8217;s always been this way and no one ever talks about it. If you weren&#8217;t Romeo Montague, you would be absolutely perfect for her. She would declare her desire to marry you immediately.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Before you can stop yourself, you&#8217;re calling up at her from the garden. You&#8217;re expounding about how you agree with her. You agree that this feud is absurd. You agree that you should be married. You tell her that your love for her will endure any trials and hardships that come between you. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Once Juliet recovers from the shock of realizing you were in the garden this whole time, she blushes and tells you to lower your voice. She is a bit hesitant about the fervor of your passion for her, but you can see from the shimmer in her blue eyes that she loves you as well.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You propose marriage, and Juliet accepts.
