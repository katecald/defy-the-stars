You decide to stay in Verona to adjust to your new married life and the complications that will inevitably arise from it. You spend the afternoon pacing around your room, thinking through different ways to talk to your parents about this. You try to find the right words to explain how alive you feel with Romeo. How his love has given you an energy you&#8217;ve never experienced before. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the evening, your nurse runs into your chambers, a distraught look on her face. She tells you that there was a fight on the streets between Romeo and your cousin Tybalt. Both Mercutio and Tybalt are dead. And even worse: Romeo is the one who killed Tybalt.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You stagger backwards from your nurse. You can&#8217;t believe this. You cannot believe that Romeo, a man you love more than life itself, would kill Tybalt, a member of your own bloodline. But your nurse keeps repeating it, almost in hysterics. Romeo killed Tybalt. Tybalt is dead. Romeo killed him. He killed Tybalt. He stabbed him. He stabbed him with his own sword. He plunged it straight through Tybalt&#8217;s gut.
</p>

<p class="indent">
You sit down on your bed and stare blankly at the floor. Part of you wants to talk to Romeo, to let him explain how this could possibly be true. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
But another part of you is broken. Romeo has murdered a part of your family. You grew up hearing stories about how bloodthirsty and cruel Montagues are. Maybe your family was right all along. Maybe he fooled you into falling in love with him. Maybe he really is a monster.
